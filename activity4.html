          <p>
            Based on the artist that was avaliable for this project, I like the wokrs from Turner more. Mainly because he's an artist I've studied for AP Art History. When I was looking through the museum links provided, I was drawn to "Dutch Boats in a Gale ('The Bridgewater Sea Piece')" because I really like the texture and color choice.

          <p>
            The work "Dutch Boats in a Gale ('The Bridgewater Sea Piece')" painted by the Joseph Mallord William Turner during 1801 was a 162.5 × 221 cm oil on canvas painting.        
          </p>
           <p>
            This painting where the boats are flipping due to the storm was commissioned by the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. The website also describes the elements of art of this painting. The color of the clouds conveys a dangerous sense to the viewers.

            Color & Contrast: The cold colors used in the background gives a sense of danger which contrasts with the warm color that was used to paint the focal point - the boat with life (human) aboard.

          <p>
            The first thing I've notice was the boat. The reason for this was due to its colors contrasting with the background. The boat leads the viewers eyes to the movements of waves which gives a sense of danger. The blurred figure caused by the movement shows their concern, and gives strong edvidence on the type of situation they're in.
          </p>
          <p>
            The artwork invites viewers to be engaged with its size, it's large enough so that as viwers stands infront of it, they're invited into another world. The waves wwith a rough texture is in contrast with the smoothness of the boat and the blurred people whose worried for thier lifes would give viewers some sense of unease when standing in front of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a painting from the Dutch Golden Age. There's serveral hints that contributes to this, this work has a low horizon line, the style of the boats are the Dutch boat and its patron was the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater.
