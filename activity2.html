              As the guard and archivist of the Astral Express, which was a train-like vehicle, Danheng in this photo was staring at the planet outside the window of Herta's Space Station's Supply Zone. This space station and Astral Express is an example of the scientific genre since people today can’t travel through the galaxy.

            Danheng Permansor Terrae showing his Earth dragon form, which is a new power earned in Amphoreus, This photo was taken in Amphoreus's Grove of Epiphany. Amphoreus is a planet related to the myths of ancient Rome as the citizens there believed in Titans, and as Titans fall, demigods considered as Chrysos Heir heroes are ones that guide them. As Danheng inherited powers from Terravox, he now is part of the Chrysos Heir heroes. This backstory would be considered in the fantasy genre since it's based on myths.

              Danheng Imbibitor Lunae's dragon feature, the water dragon from his last life, Danfeng, follows him as he enters reincarnation. This photo was taken in Xianzhou Luofu's Divination Commission. By using his Vidyadhara form, Danheng has the power of controlling water. His powers and the reincarnation feature from the Vidyadhara species is an example of the fantasy genre.

            Honkai Star Rail is a RPG game falling into the science fiction and fantasy genre. It’s a game where Trailblazer, the player, awaken in Herta's Space Station by Stellaron Hunters during Antimatter Legion’s invasion. As Trailblazer helps stop the invasion with members of the Astral Express, they are invited to join their faction. The Astral Express has been traveling from planets to planets across the galaxy. After Trailblazer joined, they’ve been to an old western style ice planet, Jarilo-VI, an ancient Chinese style planet, LuoFu Xianzhou, a modernized dream land, Penacony, and an ancient Rome style planet which was actually a computer system, Amphoreus.

            Statistics isn’t the only thing that makes up a character, their backstory and character design is also important. 
          </h4>
          <p>
            Unlike Danheng, the four star, given for free as Trailblazer pushes through the main story. Danheng Imbibitor Lunae is a 1.0 five star where players need to pull from the banner. Now at 3.0 a lot of domains and bosses couldn’t be passed with this character. Lunae’s statistics are very behind but it doesn’t stop me from liking this character. Danheng has been by the player's side ever since we met him in the space station. He promised not to step onto the land of Luofu due to being exiled but he came and used his powers just to save us. Then when we traveled to Amphoreus, Trailblazer was sent out to get help while Danheng was trapped in the system waiting thousands of years waiting for us to come back.

          <h4>
            Character design really shows a genre. 
          </h4>
          <p>
            Personally, I just really like long-haired male characters with eyeshadow dressed in fantasy style clothing. To me, Danheng’s design was really casual and didn’t catch me but later going further in the story, I’ve understood that he’s in disguise so he looks ordinary. But the maple leaves that were shown in his ultimate skill and his standby actions give hint that he can’t abandon his past. The feng in Danfeng, which was Danheng’s name before he went into reincarnation, was the word for maple in Chinese. This maple leaf would be part of the fantasy genre since it’s like an unnatural element that reminds of reincarnation of the character. I would define the fantasy genre as showing myths or some unnatural elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later in Luofu, being introduced to Danheng Imbibitor Lunae, I was amazed by his design. Coming back to Lunae’s design, the dragon is an auspicious sign in China and emperors considered themselves as it. As the leader of Vidyadhara, which was a species considered to be the heir of Dragon, the aeon or in other words god, not just the horn and tail, Lunae’s sleeves have patterns of the dragon scale. Not just dragon design, there’s also lotus design on Lunae. Lotus would also be considered as an auspicious sign showing Lunae’s pure personality. And these would be mythical elements since dragons doesn’t exist in real life. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, I like the fantasy genre that was shown in the story and character design of Danheng, who was a character in Honkai Star Rail. Well there is the science fiction genre but that’s not the reason why I stayed in the game, I stayed only because of the character design.

              Danheng is looking at his future as he says goodbye and moves on from his past. This photo was taken in Amphoreus’s Dragonbone City Styxia’s The Sea of Flowers in Memory. This would be fantasy related due to the moon where we could see the inside along with the dragon features.
