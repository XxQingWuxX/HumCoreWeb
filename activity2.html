            Honkai Star Rail is a RPG game falling into the science fiction and fantasy genre. It’s a game where players enter a force called Astral Express after they help members of Astral Express and Herta’s Space Station to stop the invasion of Antimatter Legion and travel through the galaxy entering planets to save them. So far Astral Express been to an old western style ice planet Jarilo-VI, a ancient Chinese style planet LuoFu Xianzhou, a modernized dream land Penacony, and an ancient Rome style planet which was actually a computer system, Amphoreus. 
            <p>
              Danheng is the reason why I was playing this game, I like how he’s always by the players side as we met him in the space station then we travel together and in Luofu he uses the power he didn’t plan to use just to save us, then to Amphoreus, trapped in the system waiting thousands of years for us to find our way back into the system. My favorite form was Lunae due to his long hair and Asian fantasy style outfits. The lotus and dragon scale design on him fits his identity in his last life, which is another fantasy element. His style is what made me stay in the game as it becomes power creep overtime, well personally I just really like the long hair and Asian fantasy style.           </p>
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, I like the science fiction genre due to the technology that could appear in them, I also like fantasy due to their outfits.
