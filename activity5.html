            For notes, I tend to find PDF versions of the source or scan them using CamScanner to turn them into a PDF. Then I would use Notability to directly marking it using highlight along with taking notes in the margin using my Ipad and Apple Pencil.

            When encountering unfamiliar words, I tend to look it up with safari and translate it into Chinese for better understanding.

            Audiencie of this PDF is for students whose studying hisotry especially in areas like economic, energy and enviorment since this PDF talks about the history of oil, it's importance and how it affecfted the sosciety.
          </p> 
          <p>
            Inclusion of primary sources such as the photos from the time period and secondary sources such as textbooks idenitfies it's purpose of giving information of the history with supporting sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Change of word choices from "Black Goo" to "Black Gold" identifies the centeral scholarly claims and key terminologies like commodficiation are used to show the transition. This is also similar to saying oil is black shunshine as described in lecture.

          By using primary source, it provides readers a sense of the hisotry for that time period that the transitiion of oil occurs. Both visual and written sources are provided along with geolocial edvidence  and quotes to further discribe oil back in the 1900s.

          I like the Children of the Sun: A History of Mankind's Unappeasable Appettie for Energy (New W. W. Norton, 2006), 6--62 by Alfred Crosby. I like this because when learning something I would like to know the history and the past of that. When this interests me I'll tend to continue learning about the topic.
