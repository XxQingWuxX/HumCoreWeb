            In the beginning of the quarter, I might think plants are just plants, but now with movie series by Miyazaki, especially this movie, I now think plants can also mean protection. In this scene of the movie plants helps to break the force as Ashitaka falls. It doesn’t stop the force but rather softens it. Ashitaka will be injured if he didn’t choose to jump into the forest so here plants serve as a protection.

          To me, the forrest is just a forrest, well, I might feel I dislike to the mud and animales that I can encounter since I'm not use to being in the nature but to other people forrest can be a sacred place to them since it's where they grow up and the background of the stories they listen are based on.

          In the past I think that humans is the main part in helping to purify the nature but now seeing Princess Mononoke, nature is healing itself with the help of humans. Humans recycle and chooses environment friendly materials as nature heals itself through years.        </p>

          After attending HumCore lectures, when reading books I’m not just reading it, I tend to think about what they mean and how parts will related. Now from SGGK, Annihilation, Totoro and Princess Mononoke I’m more use to close reading, now I enjoy connecting aspects and finding out what that part means.        </p>
