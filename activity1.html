            As someone who perfers to stay inside her room and doesn't walk into the nature, this photo shows a change of enviorment from indoors to outdoors as I (human) walks into the bamboo graden (nonhuman). The refreshing scent of bamboo along with the drios of water left on the grass after the drizzling rain gives cold touchess to my skin.
          <p>
            The mushy mud underneath me as I wore heals and qipao to take a photo at a lotuc lake to give the Jiangnan vibe, gives a feel that it's comsuming me. The ground underneath was very soft, after the heavy rain, most parts near the lake drowns. The grass scent after the rain combined with the scent of the lotus along with the cold and humid wind that day suddenly awakes me.

            The pomegtanate tree planted at Zhujiajiao is unripe but just seeing things that I don't usually see in cities is what caused me to take this photo and focus on it. This is an element of nature that was planted at a place full of human activities, an ancient town called Zhujiajiao.

            The boat is a human made object, carrying hundreds of people sailing on a lake to see the beautiful scenery of the Bund in Shanghai. I tooked this photo due to this being a site that attracts me and mainly because this a time where human made objects going through nature peacefuly. In this photo, viewers can see the interactions of the human controlled boat with the currents of the lake, along with the animals that lives inside the lake.
